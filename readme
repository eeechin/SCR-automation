# DBS Check Expiry Reminder

This is a lightweight Google Apps Script tool designed to help tutoring businesses or educational organizations monitor the expiry of DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) certificates stored in a Google Sheet. It automatically checks certificate issue dates, flags those nearing or past expiry, and sends email reminders or reports.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Automatically parses DBS issue dates from a Google Sheet
- ‚úÖ Flags certificates nearing expiry (11+ months old) or expired (12+ months old)
- ‚úÖ Sends internal email alerts or tutor reminders (if email addresses are available)
- ‚úÖ Generates on-demand or scheduled reports
- ‚úÖ Built entirely in Google Apps Script (no hosting or external services required)

## üìÅ Google Sheet Format

Your sheet should have at least the following columns:

| First Name | Last Name | DBS Issue Date |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Jane       | Smith     | 2023-06-28 |

The script expects the first name in column **A**, last name in column **B**, and the DBS issue date in column **D**.

Add `checkDbs.gs` to your Google Sheets project. The `checkOldDBS()` function
automatically runs when the spreadsheet is opened and will display a pop-up
listing tutors whose DBS certificates are over a year old. The script uses
`parseDBSDate()` to handle either true Date values or text strings (e.g.
`YYYY-MM-DD` or `DD/MM/YYYY`) so you don't have to worry about formatting
differences in your sheet.

For debugging purposes you can also run `debugListDiffDays()` from the
Apps Script editor. It will show every tutor alongside the number of days since
their certificate was issued so you can confirm the dates are read correctly.
